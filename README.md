- 👋 Hi, I’m @aaliceinw - I am a total noobie and very curious about learning new stuff. 
- 👀 I’m interested in changing the way we do things. I think by coding we can ethically influence the right behaviours.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics about coding, starting with HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, I don't yet but probably programmes dealing with psychometrics, neuroscience, mindfulness and wellness. 
- 📫 How to reach me. Chat to me here first. I am way too new to dare share the real me yet. As I get more comfortable, I may share other ways to connect.
