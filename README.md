- 👋 Hi, I’m @aaliceinw - I am now a novice and still very curious about learning new stuff. 

- 👀 I’m interested in changing the way we do things for the betterment of humanity. I think by coding we can ethically influence the right behaviours.

- 🥇 I've just graduated (04 Aug 2021) as a Software Engineer from the intense 14 week Talent Tech Academey Coding bootcamp - from knowing zero code to delivering a responsive Hospital Management System using Java and it's many servlets

- 💞️ I’m looking for collaborators to build an LMS for change makers and change practitioners. It's a personal project to hone my skills but also for all of us to commercially benefit!

- 📫 How to reach me. I'm on linkedin and you can email me on embracingchange4@gmail.com

- WHAT AN AWESOME JOURNEY SO FAR
